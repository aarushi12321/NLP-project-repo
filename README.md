Overall Goal :
Use simple language and fun elements to create an intuitive, exciting chat-bot
for kids.

Scope :
The prototype will have the following features : 
Have customisable features for the type of chats the user wants to have -
descriptive, bullet-points-based, customisable length, etc.
Provide interactive, fun science quizzes to spark curiosity and make learning
enjoyable for kids based on their area of interest or queries.
Generate reports based on quiz performance, showing progress and areas of
interest and improvement
